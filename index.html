         <h2>Introduction</h2>
         <p>As more citizens in the United States gain access to computers and the internet, the Federal Government will be pressured by citizens and stakeholders to provide more efficient and effective e-government services. However, the Federal Government is not able to provide the most efficient and effective services to the public. Issues of protecting the privacy of user data, as well as creating interoperable information systems hault their services.</p>

      <h2>History</h2>
       
      <p>Electronic government or e-government refers to the government using information and communication technologies ("ICTs) to provide services to the public (Gottschalk, 2009). In regards to the government, ICTs mainly refer to the use of the internet to provide services to citizens, partners, other governments and its employees through the use of any communication device such as a radio, cell phone, computer and satellite (Layne & Lee, 2001; Rouse, n.da). The benefits of e-government is that it allows the public to interact with the government without being restricted by limited office hours and reduces the need to travel to government offices (Rose & Grant, 2010). However, in the United States, the Federal Government has issues in providing efficient and effective e-government services due to the issues of protecting the privacy of user data and creating government systems that are interoperable.</p>
       
      <p> In regards to privacy, federal agencies have struggled with finding a balance with the use of web measurement and customization technologies and cookies. According to the Office of Management and Budget ("OMB"), whose office has taken the lead in e-government services in the Federal Government, web measurement and communication technologies refers to any technology which can recall an internet user's interaction with a website so that those who collect this information can perform an analysis of the data (Office of Management and Budget [OMB], 2010a). Moreover, they can provide the user of the website a better experience (OMB, 2010a). In the simplest sense, a cookie is a piece of data placed by a website on a user's hard drive so that the cookies can remember information about the user (Rouse, n.db). In most cases a cookie will remember a user's preference when visiting a website (Rouse, n.db). Cookie usage on federal agencies' websites can benefit users as they will not have to fill out the same information multiple times and will remember their website settings (Chadbrow, 2010).</p>
       
      <p>However, in 2000 the OMB nearly completely banned the use of cookies by federal agencies due to privacy concerns (McCarthy & Yates, 2010; Jorgenson, 2006). After nearly a decade, in 2010 the OMB reversed their policies on cookies, but still managed to place limitations on its usage (Hoover, 2010). The OMB has struggled to find a balance in protecting the privacy of the public while also trying to make sure that federal government websites provide better services and are user friendly (McCarthy & Yates, 2010). Furthermore, the Federal Government experiences issue in providing e-authentications due to its role as an issuer, provider and relying party of identity documents (Holden & Millett, 2005). E-authentications refers to website users being able to log into one site, by using their credentials, and being able to have access to multiple e-government services (Holden & Millett, 2005). It also experiences issues in protecting user data when sharing data between its agencies and other levels of government (Holden & Millett, 2005). To remedy the issue of incidental sharing, federal agencies are required by the E-Government Act of 2002, to conduct private impact analysis of their information systems (Holden & Millett, 2005). Information systems refer to the use of hardware, software, computer connections and information systems users to transmit information (Information, n.d). The private impact analysis looks at how data is collected by federal agencies so that the agency can try and strengthen their information system from data leakage (Holden & Millett, 2005).</p>
       
      <p>Interoperability refers to different agencies making their information systems work together so that they can exchange information (Gottschalk, 2009). The Department of Defense and the Department of Veteran Affairs have managed to make an interoperable system called CHDR to provide health services to retiring veterans (Hufnagel, 2009). In the Federal Government it is probably one of the better interoperable systems, but still suffers from minor issues.</p>

      <h2>Stages of E-Governemnt</h2>
       
      <p> Federal government web portals or e-government websites, such as Firstgov.gov, can go through four stages called the cataloguing, transaction, vertical integration, and horizontal integration. Each of these stages is important as in later sections they relate to the issues of privacy and interoperability. The first stage is the catalog stage in which a government agency is only worried about presenting government information to the public. A government agency is usually forced to put up this online presence due to the demands of citizens and stakeholders. By providing information online the government agencies can save staff time from answering simple questions from the public. However, as the amount of information on the site increases, the site will soon need an index as well as links to other government websites (Layne & Lee, 2001).</p>
       
      <p>The transaction stage is citizens can perform online transactions with the government. For instance, citizens would be able to pay for license renewals as well as pay for fines. Compared to the catalog stage, the transaction stage provides more financial savings for government and citizens. Citizens no longer have to travel to government offices to receive services and government is able to use less paper. As more transactions occur with the government it will eventually pressure government agencies to try to integrate their systems. Vertical integration refers to the interoperability of systems across government levels. This means the sharing of data between local, state and federal government. For instance, if a person applied for a business license at the local level, their system should be able to check state and federal databases for records on the person. The last stage, horizontal integration, refers to the integration of government systems on the same level. For instance, if a business needed to pay unemployment insurance at a state agency they should also be able to pay their state business tax at the same time (Layne & Lee, 2001).</p>
