         <p>When citizens access websites for federal programs such as Medicaid to apply for benefits privacy concerns begin to appear (Wilson, 2014; Holden & Millett, 2005). When a user first accesses one of these websites privacy concerns appears because these federal websites can log the user's IP address as well as store cookies on a user's system. Even when user's start to make transactions with the government, they will be asked for personally identifying information such as their social security number which can be used to start making a profile for the user. At the next stage, federal agencies may gain a user's consent to use their social security number when they apply for federal benefit programs. Federal income based benefits programs will use this social security number to check the user's income by cross referencing it with the user's tax return held by the Internal Revenue Service. Although, cross referencing the social security number helps prevent fraud, sharing the social security number may lead to the disclosure of excess information that the other agency may not have (Holden & Millett, 2005)</p>

      <h2>What are cookies and their purpose?</h2>
       
      <p>When an internet user connects to a federal government website, the user is considered to be the client, and the federal government website is the server. The connection between the client and the server is called the HTTP protocol. When a client connects to a server the connection is considered stateless, because when the client ends the HTTP protocol there is no memory of the connection. However, because of this, a computer service company called Netscape created cookies. Cookies are considered pieces of data that save some of the information that occurred during the connection between the client and server. When a client connects to the server's website the server's database create a unique identification ("ID") for the client and transits the ID with the cookie to the client's computer to be saved. Inside the cookie are URLs or addresses for online websites. When the client connects to one of the URLs found in the cookie, the client's web browser will take stored information from the cookie and send it the server. It will then be saved in the server's database in which it will be linked with the ID for the client (McCarthy & Yates, 2010.</p>
       
      <p>There are many types of cookies, but for site I will only explain session cookies and persistent cookies. Session cookies are only available for a single session between the client and server. Session cookies were usually used by federal agencies to conduct surveys about people who used their website. Furthermore, there are persistent cookies that are stored on a user's computer until a specified date. Information from persistent cookies can be accessed multiple times by the server to sense a pattern or behavior in website browsing habits by the user. Netscape's original purpose for creating cookies were to provide help to online shoppers. Their items would be saved in their shopping cart saving them time. However, the federal government has used them to benefit the public in other ways (McCarthy & Yates, 2010).</p>
       
      <h3>Cookies benefits and Privacy Risks</h3>
       
      <div class="desktop">

      </div>
       
      <p>Cookies are able to benefit federal agencies and their website users in two ways. First, by using persistent cookies, federal agencies would be able to make a customizable experience for users (McCarthy & Yates, 2010). The persistent cookies would be able to track and save a user preferences and website settings (McCarthy & Yates, 2010). The second benefit is that cookies help federal agencies know what their users are requesting and are able to collect data on them (McCarthy & Yates, 2010). This means that the federal agencies would be able to make changes to their website to support users and provide better service (McCarthy & Yates, 2010).</p>
       
      <p>Although these benefits are great for easy website usage, there are a few risks to privacy (Layne & Lee, 2001). One fear of the use of cookies by the Federal Government is that third party cookies may get a hold of personally identifiable information of users (McCarthy & Yates, 2010). Third party cookies refer to cookies that are created by a website that is different than the one the user is visiting (PCmag, n.d). Issues become prevalent when federal government websites provide links to other websites, such as social media sites, which may use third party cookies. Third party cookies can begin to create a profile about a user that may not even be correct (McCarthy & Yates, 2010). For instance, if a computer user accidently clicks on a website the third party cookie will collect incorrect information (McCarthy & Yates, 2010). Furthermore, third party cookies companies can sell information about the user to other companies that can create an even more complete profile about the user (McCarthy & Yates, 2010).</p>
       
      <p>However, in 2000 the OMB nearly completely banned the use of cookies by federal agencies due to privacy concerns (McCarthy & Yates, 2010; Jorgenson, 2006). After nearly a decade, in 2010 the OMB reversed their policies on cookies, but still managed to place limitations on its usage (Hoover, 2010). The OMB has struggled to find a balance in protecting the privacy of the public while also trying to make sure that federal government websites provide better services and are user friendly (McCarthy & Yates, 2010). Furthermore, the Federal Government experiences issue in providing e-authentications due to its role as an issuer, provider and relying party of identity documents (Holden & Millett, 2005). E-authentications refers to website users being able to log into one site, by using their credentials, and being able to have access to multiple e-government services (Holden & Millett, 2005). It also experiences issues in protecting user data when sharing data between its agencies and other levels of government (Holden & Millett, 2005). To remedy the issue of incidental sharing, federal agencies are required by the E-Government Act of 2002, to conduct private impact analysis of their information systems (Holden & Millett, 2005). Information systems refer to the use of hardware, software, computer connections and information systems users to transmit information (Information, n.d). The private impact analysis looks at how data is collected by federal agencies so that the agency can try and strengthen their information system from data leakage (Holden & Millett, 2005)</p>
       
      <p>Interoperability refers to different agencies making their information systems work together so that they can exchange information (Gottschalk, 2009). The Department of Defense and the Department of Veteran Affairs have managed to make an interoperable system called CHDR so that they can provide health services to retiring veterans (Hufnagel, 2009). In the Federal Government it is probably one of the better interoperable systems, but still suffers from minor issues.</p>
       
      <h3>New Policies on Cookies </h3>
       
      <p>In 2005, despite being told that cookies would create anonymous profiles and collect unidentifiable information, only 62% of consumers agreed to the use of cookies (McCarthy & Yates, 2010). However, in 2010 the OMB changed its policy on the usage of cookies and third party services for federal agencies in its memorandum called, M-10-22, Guidance for Online Use of Web Measurement and Customization Technologies (OMB, 2010a). It seems like the OMB was more worried about the Federal Govenrnment's ability to engage the public online; close the information technology gap between the public and private sector; as well as the Federal Govenrnment's ability to use third party websites such as YouTube  (Howard, 2010). Third party websites or applications refer to web-based technologies that are not owned by the government or are partially involved with nongovernmental entities (OMB, 2010b). Some of these applications can be on another site or be embedded on a government site such as a YouTube video (OMB, 2010b).</p>
       
      <p>The new policies have made major changes in the usage of cookies and web measurement and customization technologies by federal agencies. For instance, the OMB has now given federal agencies the option to use three tiers of web measurement and customization technologies and cookies (OMB, 2010a). Tier 1 allows federal agencies to use single session cookies and tier 2 allows the use of persistent cookies without the collection of personally identifiable information. Furthermore, tier 3 allows the usage of persistent cookies with the collection of personally identifiable information. Federal agencies are allowed to use tier 1 and 2 as long as they abide by policies regarding the usage of technology and include in their privacy policy that they are using these technologies. However, for tier 3 the agency must submit a proposal to a senior agency official for privacy and have the proposal open to the public for 30 days where it can be commented on. Moreover, changes may be made to the proposal due to comments made by the public and the proposal must receive approval by the agency's chief information officer (OMB, 2010a).</p>
       
      <p>The OMB also mandated that federal agencies have the ability for users to decline or accept the use of web measurement and customization technologies and cookies (OMB, 2010a). The ability to decline must be easily accessible to the public and the agency must provide those who decline with information that is comparable to those who do accept the use of web measurement and customization technologies (OMB, 2010a). If a button to decline is inaccessible the federal agency can post the procedure for users to disable cookies from their web browser (OMB, 2010a). Furthermore, the OMB has created policies regarding third party website and applications in their memorandum called Guidance for Agency Use of Third-Party Websites and Applications (OMB, 2010b). The memorandum states that federal agencies should provide information comparable to information it has provided to the public on third party websites such as social media sites (OMB, 2010b).</p>
       
      <p>Moreover, the agency should provide warnings if users click a link on their site that leads to a third party website and should monitor the privacy policies of the third party websites that users are directed to (OMB, 2010b). Lastly, if third party applications or cookies collect personally identifiable information on behalf of an agency they should only collect just enough to accomplish the purpose that the information is collected for (OMB, 2010b). These policies may not be effective in protecting people's privacy. In some cases, people who are not very computer literate may not know how to manually disable cookies and will not try to although direction are available. Furthermore, if they do disable them, they will constantly have to turn cookies off and on as they will venture to other sites that do need them. Another issue is that the OMB is still allowing the use of third party cookies which is what created the fear of privacy leaks.</p>
       
      <h2>E-authentications</h2>
       
      <div class="login"> 
         <img src="images/login.jpg" class="loginimage">
      </div>
       
      <p>E-authentications refers to government website users logging into one site, using their credentials and being able to have access to multiple e-government services. As seen in the vertical and horizontal stages of e-government a person would only have to log in once to get the benefit of multiple services. However, systems that use common credentials and share information will have privacy risks. One struggle the Federal Government faces in providing e-authentication services is that it is an issuer, provider and relying party of identity documents. In regards, to issuing documents the Federal Government is able to control the behavior of citizens. For instance, if a person were to board a flight, they would need to present photo identification that has been issued by the government. If the person were to present a form of identification that was given to them by their employee the airline employee would not accept it due to homeland security policies. This gives the perception that government identification holds greater value than any other form of identification. This even transfers when beneficiaries need government identification to apply for federal government programs. However, this great value leads to people creating fake forms of identification (Holden & Millett, 2005).</p>
       
      <p>As a relying party, the Federal Government faces trouble due to the large amount of people it has to pay benefits and release sensitive information to base on the fact that people are who they say they are. The Federal Government has to deal with a wide range of groups such as non-profit organizations, citizens, businesses as well as multinational governments. This means it also has to deal with a wide range of transactions. Due to the wide range of groups that will be using e-authentications, it is almost sure to say that there will be privacy implications when sharing data within the Federal Government. For instance, users log into a site using e-authentication they may enter a common identifier. This will lead to different system linking together and soon to the creation of a profile for the user from different databases (Holden & Millett, 2005).</p>
       
      <h3>Private Impact Analysis</h3>
       
      <p>To try to stop the leakage of data and the incidental sharing of data the E-Government Act of 2002, requires federal agencies to conduct privacy impact analysis ("PIA") of their information system. The PIAs look at how data is collected by the Federal Government. It observes whether the handling of data is compliant with federal regulations regarding privacy. Moreover, it looks at the risk of taking in data, managing data, and disseminating data when using their information system. Lastly, it allows agencies to look for improved methods of handling data. These PIAs are helpful when converting paper based systems into electronic systems as well as when making changes to an existing system. Furthermore, they should be conducted early in the life of an information system to create a system that mitigates privacy concerns (Holden & Millett, 2005).</p>
