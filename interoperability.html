         <p>The goal of having interoperable systems in e-government is to be able to exchange information and use the information that is exchanged. The Federal Government has had issues with the vertical and horizontal integration of their information systems which has caused the delivery of less efficient services. Interoperability also has stages of growth and issues can occur between agencies. These include technical as well as organizational issues. The first level is computer interoperability, which refers to the ability of information systems to understand the information that is sent between each system. The next level is process interoperability, which means that in each organization employees should be performing their work in a way that supports their organization as well as the organization they are working with (Gottschalk, 2009).</p>
          
         <p>Then there is knowledge interoperability, which means that the organization should create a strategy on how they are collecting and sharing information. This will help alleviate issues such as incorrect data   definitions when sharing information. Level four is value interoperability, which looks at what the organizations are doing. There are different types of value, but the one that is most important for the next section is value shop. Value shop means that that the value of an organization lies in providing solutions for clients based on their knowledge. For instance, a hospitals solve problems for their patients. In the next section, the Department of Defense and Department of Veteran Affairs provide medical services for service members and veterans. The last level is goal interoperability, in which the interoperable systems should be supporting the strategy of each participating organization (Gottschalk, 2009). Some of these stages can be seen in the interoperable system between the Department of Defense ("DOD") and the Department of Veteran Affairs ("DOA").</p>

      <h2>The Department of Defense and the Department of Veteran Affairs</h2>
       
      <p>The DOD and the DOA hold electronic health records for military personnel who later become veterans (Hufnagel, 2009). Electronic health records are electronic versions of medical health documents and are a gathering of health information about a person (Hufnagel, 2009). This information can include the person's, health issues, medications, past medical history and progress reports (Hufnagel, 2009). It is approximated that each year over 150,000 military service members convert to veteran status (Panangala & Jansen, 2010). Both departments have a goal of providing services to their beneficiaries. However, there are issues due to service member's health records are scattered across DOD and VA facilities and those who go to a VA facility need their records from the DOD (Panangala & Jansen, 2010). This can lead to inefficient services for veterans and can delay healing for the wounded (Panangala & Jansen, 2010). To remedy this issue the DOD and VA has created multiple interoperable systems. I will discuss one of their interoperable information system called the Clinical Data Repository/ Health Data Repository (CHDR) Repository.</p>

      </div>
       
      <p>The DOD and VA created CHDR in September of 2006 and is an example of horizontal interoperability. The system allows the DOD and the VA to share medication and allergy data when they receive treatment from the DOD. The DOD has formatted its data so that it is compatible with the information system at the VA. However, the DOD has not completely converted all of its paper documents to electronic health records. To make sure that data from all patients are not shared, the system only allows patients who have visited both a DOD and VA medical center information to be transferred through the system. The system looks for common identifiers in the DOD and VA system such as names, birthdates, and social security numbers which will turn a patient into an active shared patient. Once the patient is activated both departments can receive real time updates about the patient (Hufnagel, 2009).</p>
      <p>Furthermore, the DOD and the VA have agreed on numerous standards in regards to sharing information such as their Target DOD/VA Health Standards Profile (Hufnagel, 2009). This profile was created by both departments in 2004 to make sure that their information systems stay in compliance with federal regulations (Hufnagel, 2009). For instance, the profile was updated in 2008 to include file sharing standards created by the American National Standards Institute (Hufnagel, 2009). The American National Standards Institute is a non-profit that creates computer standards in the United States (ANSI, n.d). Moreover, they have agreed to use the SNOMED CT data standards for allergic reactions. SNOMED CT is standardized medical terminology so that when the DOD and VA systems exchange information doctors have an understanding of what the other is sending (Hufnagel, 2009).</p>
